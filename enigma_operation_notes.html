<center>Enigma Simulation - Operation Notes</center>
</header>
<div class="indent12">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document is sort-of an operation manual for the Enigma simulation.
It is not much, but here it is.
</p>
<p>
To use the Enigma machine simulation to communicate
requires a shared rotor, reflector, plugboard configuration.
<ul>
<li>The reflector is fixed and never changes.</li>
<li>The plugboard is changed periodically on an agreed upon schedule. weekly? daily? hourly?</li>
<li>Which rotors ("I",...,"VII") to use is also part of the published schedule.</li>
<li>The rotors have initial settings and rotate with each character of a message.
(They rotate in a fixed pattern so the sender and receiver can repeat it.)
</li>
<li>The rotor's initial position are part of each message.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It is always a good idea to read the code
files for more information. The structure of the code and the comments in the
code are another form of documentation.
</p>

<h2>Enigma Machine Simulation Configuration</h2>
<p>
The Enigma machine simulation configuration is in a file.
It contains rotor, reflector, and plugboard "wiring" and
is created by a user. To communicate, the configuration (file) must be shared
and used by others.
</p>
<p>
Which rotors to use and their order (left,middle,right),
and the rotor's initial (starting) position must be communicates
another way. It could be communicated verbally or written down.
</p>

<h2>Creating Configuration Files</h2>
<p>
The program <code>create_emigma_config_file.py</code> is available and
is used to create configuration files. The file is a simple
comma separated value (csv) file. The file format can be understood by
reading the file.
</p>
<p>
The program allows the user to select one of several alphabets and also set plugboard
pairs as part of the enigma simulation configuration. It creates the file
<code>enigma_config.csv</code>.
</p>

<h2>Multiple Configuration Files</h2>
<p>
When communicating with a large number of people you may need separate
configuration files for different groups. The enigma machine simulation programs
has a build in default configuration file name (<code>enigma_config.csv</code>).
If you do not want to use the default, you may include a different configuration
file as the first parameter on the command line.
<p></p>
To create separate configuration files:
<ol>
<li>Create a config file using <code>create_enigma_config_file.py</code>.
This will create a config file having new "wiring" for rotors, and reflector.
(Perhaps a new plugboard setup if you enter different character pairs.)</li>
<li>Rename the new config file (<code>enigma_config.py</code>).</li>
<li>Include the renamed config file on the command line.</li>
</ol>
</p>
 
<h2>Send and Receiving Messages</h2>
<p>
<i>These steps are from:
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/08/22/the-enigma-enigma-how-the-enigma-machine-worked/">
The Enigma Enigma: How The Enigma Machine Worked</a></i>
</p>
<p>
The sender and receiver must use the same configuration of the enigma machine in
order to communicate. They must know
<ul>
<li>the rotors to be used (I, ... ,VIII)</li>
<li>the order of the rotors (left,middle,right)</li>
<li>the plugboard configuration</li>
</ul>
These were published and changed regularly (hourly? daily?). The sender and receiver
looked up this information and configure their enigma machines accordingly.
</p>
<p>
To set the rotor starting positions, the person doing the encrypting
selects random rotor positions and includes them at the start of a message.
<ol>
<li>Make up an initial start position. For example
ABC, and a message key, DEF.</li>
<li>Set the rotors to ABC and type in DEF. Letâ€™s say that
encrypts to GHI.</li>
<li>Next set the rotors to the message key, DEF, and start typing the
plaintext message.</li>
<li>Record the output, which is the ciphertext.</li>
<li>Transmit the initial start position ABC, the encrypted message key GHI,
and then the ciphertext.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The person decrypting the message would
<ol>
<li>Set the rotors to the first three letters received, ABC.</li>
<li>type in the next three letters, GHI. DEF is output.</li>
<li>sets the rotors to DEF.</li>
<li>Start typing the ciphertext message. The output is
the plaintext message.</li>
</ol>
